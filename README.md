Description:

Analyzing the Energy Efficiency of Buildings The dataset includes features such as surface/wall/roof area, glass area, glass area distribution and orientation of 768 simulated building shapes. Based on this data, it is aimed to estimate the heating and cooling load of the building. In this age where environmental awareness is very important, it can be a super consultancy initiative to reduce our carbon footprint, as we still haven't switched to renewable energy sources.

Data Set Information:

We perform energy analysis using 12 different building shapes. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to analyse the energy consumption patterns in buildings and to predict two real valued responses.
