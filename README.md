1. Analyzing the Energy Efficiency of Buildings

Description:

Analyzing the Energy Efficiency of Buildings The dataset includes features such as surface/wall/roof area, glass area, glass area distribution and orientation of 768 simulated building shapes. Based on this data, it is aimed to estimate the heating and cooling load of the building. In this age where environmental awareness is very important, it can be a super consultancy initiative to reduce our carbon footprint, as we still haven't switched to renewable energy sources.

Data Set Information:

We perform energy analysis using 12 different building shapes. The buildings differ with respect to the glazing area, the glazing area distribution, and the orientation, amongst other parameters. We simulate various settings as functions of the afore-mentioned characteristics to obtain 768 building shapes. The dataset comprises 768 samples and 8 features, aiming to analyse the energy consumption patterns in buildings and to predict two real valued responses.

Attribute Information:

The dataset contains eight attributes (or features, denoted by X1…X8) and two responses (or outcomes, denoted by Y1 and Y2). The aim is to use the eight features to analyze the dataset and predict each of the two responses. X1: Relative Compactness, X2: Surface Area, X3: Wall Area, X4: Roof Area, X5: Overall Height, X6: Orientation, X7: Glazing Area, X8: Glazing Area Distribution, Y1: Heating Load, Y2: Cooling Load. A dataset “Energy_dataset.csv” is provided for data analytics.

2. Telecom Case Study

Description:

This case study is about a telecom company. Data analytics can help this company to make smarter decisions that lead to higher productivity and more efficient operations. One of the key parameters that should be checked for this company is churn rate. Churn, often known as “churn rate,” is the measurement of the number of subscription customers who have cancelled their subscription over a set period of time.

Generally, churn rate, sometimes known as attrition rate in business, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period of time. Churn rate is the percentage of subscribers to a service that discontinue their subscription to that service in each period. In order for a company to expand its clientele, its growth rate (i.e. its number of new customers) must exceed its churn rate.

The first way to reduce the churn rate and consequently improve business retention is about making the most effective use of a telco's internal data. All this data allows telecom companies to know customers better–to the point where they can collect them into precise and consistent segments. In this case study, with some variables we need to show whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not. In telecom terminology, this is referred to as churning and not churning, respectively. Some improvements will make possible in this company through your data analytics. A dataset “telecom_dataset.csv” is provided for data analytics. You need to complete each step in the following order.
